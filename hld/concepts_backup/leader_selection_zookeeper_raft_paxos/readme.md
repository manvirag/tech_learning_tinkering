#### Leader Selection Algorithm means:

- What if master fail in master slave architecture ?
- Then we need to select a leader from the slave , that algorithm used for this is called leader selection algorithm.
- Bully and Ring Algorithm â€” designed for different distributed system configuration ( check when require ).

#### Zookeeper 

- ZooKeeper is a distributed, open-source coordination service for distributed applications.
- Used in master-slave.
- Zookeeper internally use tree like structure like file system, and node is called znode.
- Znodes in ZooKeeper offer the ability to store data and have children, maintain metadata like version and transaction ID, support Access Control Lists (ACL) for permissions, including username/password authentication, and provide notification for any changes.
- This is the guy who responsible for selecting leader with some leader selection algorithms and other duties.[ Configuration management, Locks in distributed systems,  Maintain and detect if any server leaves or joins a cluster and store other complex information of a cluster]
- this is also have cluster with replication , to avoid SPOF of this service.
- inside cluster it also has leader ( based on voting ) and follower.
- client can connect to leader or follower for delete/write/read. if it comes to follower, it will tell to leader and will broadcast to all follower.
- zookeeper is not meant to store for much data, and definitely not a cache.Instead, it's for managing heartbeats/knowing what servers are online, storing/updating configuration etc.
- Its very simple can't store different type of data structure, also it doesn't store much data, also it replicated the data to nodes provide consistency.
- zookeeper vs normal key-store. ( why kafka used this instead of any other key-value store) [ to be honest don't know ]
- quote: "You're comparing the high-level data model of ZooKeeper to other key value stores, but that's not what makes it unique. From a distributed systems standpoint, ZooKeeper is different than many other key value stores (especially Redis) because it is strongly consistent and can tolerate failures while a majority of the cluster is connected. Additionally, while data is held in memory, it's synchronously replicated to a majority of the cluster and backed by disk, so once a write succeeds, it guarantees that write will not be lost (barring a missile strike). This makes ZooKeeper very useful for storing small amounts of mission critical state like configurations."

#### Raft
- This is consensus algorithm [ what ? -> [Link](https://www.notion.so/Distributed-consensus-63b85ade896c4e49ade80ac361690953) ]
- Used in multi-master , master-master.
- It internally uses leader and follower kind of concept,On a high level: when ever write request comes it first send to leader , then it send to follow . once get the ack , leader commit and tells follower to commit as well.

#### Paxos

- Used in multi-master , master-master.

#### Heart beat detection in distributed system

-  If there is a central server, all servers periodically send a heartbeat message to it. If there is no central server, all servers randomly choose a set of servers and send them a heartbeat message every few seconds. This way, if no heartbeat message is received from a server for a while, the system can suspect that the server might have crashed. If there is no heartbeat within a configured timeout period, the system can conclude that the server is not alive anymore and stop sending requests to it and start working on its replacement
