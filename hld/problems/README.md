Decision Making | Trade-off | Which to select and why to select. | Reduce code





**Step:**

1. **Functional Requirements**.

    what the software system should do?
    
    They outline the specific functions, features, and capabilities that the software must provide to meet the user's needs

    for e.g., we want to make a cache

   1. get(key)
   2. put(key, value) etc.
   3. in short features part comes in this.
      → API designing. CRUD
      → API error handling.
      → Data modeling.
      → Query.

2. **Non-Function Requirements. (Jo ki tume batai nahi jayagi , but understood hota hai)**

    These requirements answer questions like "How should the software perform?”

    for e.g. performance, scalability, availability, security, etc.

    → load balancing <br>
    → consistent hashing <br>
    → sharding <br>
    → data backup, replication, distribution <br>
    → security firewall vpn etc. authentication + authorisation + access control + rate limiting <br>
    → caching <br>
    → monitoring and alerting. <br>
    → metrics and analytics. <br>
    → logs analysis. <br>
    → continuous deployment → deployment without downtime. <br>
    → Https using <br>
    → testing before deployment  → load testing + unit test + integration test <br>
    → async messaging system, queuing system <br>
    → DNS domain name system. <br>


3. **Estimation and Constraints**

   Estimate the scale of the system we're going to design. It is important to ask questions such as:These questions will help us scale our design later.

   1. "What is the desired scale that this system will need to handle?"
   2. "What is the read/write ratio of our system?"
   3. "How many requests per second?"
   4. "How much storage will be needed?"
   

4. **Data Estimations.**

    The back of the envelope estimation:
    
    → This is a rough estimation
    → Don’t spend much time, because the interview says scalable. so it mostly will have scalable components like a load balancer etc.
    → Keep number simple 2^x
    
    | Zeros | Traffic | Storage |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 3 | thousand | KB |
    | 6 | million | MB |
    | 9 | billion | GB |
    | 12 | Trillian | TB |
    | 15 | quadrillion | PB |
    
    char →  2 bytes
    
    long/double → 8 bytes
    
    image avg → 300kb
    
    trade → cap theorem
    
    …
    5 millions user * 1kb → 5 gb storage
    
**Steps:**

**Traffic Estimations:
→** total no of requests per second on service.

→ total no of queries per second on storage.



DAU → daily active user <br>
MAU → monthly active user.

→ Write request <br>
→ Read request <br>
→ read  heavy or write heavy ? <br>



**Storage Estimations:
→** 5-year storage


**Bandwidth estimations:**

amount of data transfer per second.

**Ram Estimations(for e.g cache):**

→ total ram

**No of Machines with RAM:**



| Availability (percentage) | Downtime per year |
| --- | --- |
| 99 | 3.6 days |
| 99.99 | 52 minutes |
| 99.999 | 5 minutes |
| 99.9999 | 31 seconds |


5. **High-level design (API + diagraming)** <br>
6. **Deep dive into the design and its components.** 
   1. This can be its data model designing and database design.
   2. This can be its api design.
   3. This can be its low level implementation.
   4. This can be any particular component.
7. **Identify bottlenecks and scalability.** <br>
