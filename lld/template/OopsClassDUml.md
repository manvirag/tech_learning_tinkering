Template
- All class will map to that relational model.
- Those which we are pointing as foreign key , instead of that we will have its object.
- When ever we have different value for a particular column, we can use the interface. (rule condition).
- Apart from this , there are different design pattern which are not very specific to attribute but can use in constructure and methods.
