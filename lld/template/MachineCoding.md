- Template:
    - Understand requirements and doubt and scope out.
    - make mental model about the types.
    - Repo Structure: 
        - controller -> usecase/service -> model -> modelrepo
        - No need to create controller , write all these in main.go
        - Usecase only when require, else simplify call the repo layer with main.go for demoing purpose. Only the actually or required thing can go to usecase.
        - model and model repo can be put in same director to speed up and repo will have inmemory data.
        - Now write Heading:  model , repo, usecase -> create the entities + attribute + methods.
        - Now optimise or break it with design patterns and solid principles.
        - Code up and run layer by layer -> like first complete -> user + usermodel +userrepo + userusecase + its main -> then other layers.
- Please check the solved problem -> they are only solved by this and because of that failed in lld , because never need to made the class diagram and data modelingn in that case , but worked for the machine coding round
